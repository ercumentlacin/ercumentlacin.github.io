            Hello! I&apos;m Erc√ºment, a Frontend Developer based in Turkey.
            I&apos;ve been interested in frontend development since my high
            school years, and I&apos;ve been professionally involved in this
            field for the past 4 years.

            <Balancer>Favorite Technologies</Balancer>
          </h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript, TypeScript, and React are my favorite programming
            languages and technologies. I believe that JavaScript has unlimited
            potential and I see it as a Swiss army knife. React, on the other
            hand, is my preferred JavaScript library. I find it easier to learn
            and use compared to other libraries.

          <p>
            To be a successful frontend developer, I believe in not being afraid
            to make mistakes, asking the right questions, and constantly
            researching. Technology is advancing rapidly, so staying up to date
            and following new trends is crucial to me.
